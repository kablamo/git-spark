=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plot your git commit history on the commandline with sparklines and "vertical"
sparklines.  

=head1 COMPARING GRAPHS

Comparing graphs is often difficult because the scaling changes for different
data sets.  For example these two data series produce identical graphs despite
have very different data.

    $ spark 1 2 3 4 5
    ▁▂▄▆█
    $ spark 10 20 30 40 50
    ▁▂▄▆█

To solve this, you must put a max and a min in front of the data to get
consistent scaling.  For example:

    $ spark 50 1 1 2 3 4 5
    █▁▁▁▁▁▁
    $ spark 50 1 10 20 30 40 50
    █▁▂▃▅▆█

git-spark assumes the min is zero and users can pass in the max using
the --scale option.  (Note that git-spark chops off the max/min characters from
the output so this is all hidden behind the scenes.)

The --scale option is also relavent to git-vspark.
